# Genesis Library

Java library to create Tokens with different Properties, Underlyings and Operations.

* Properties: inherent characters of a token. I.e. name, symbol, token cap etc.
* Underlyings: Gives value to the token. Is the token backed up by a commodity, service (i.e. storage), etc.
* Operations: Actions which can be performed with the token. I.e. a transaction of value. Another example is the incentivization of a behavior. I.e. new token is mined for planting trees

The project is written with the netbeans IDE.

An example project exists, which uses this library. It is called GenesisApp: www.github.com/FuturICT2/GenesisApp. In case of questions, please contact: bmark@ethz.ch.

## Software Architecture (little bit outdated) for the Challenge

* Challenge 1: replace the SQLlite repository (of the GenesisApp project, the other repository :)) with ad blockchain technology
* Challenge 2: extend the Operation interfaces
